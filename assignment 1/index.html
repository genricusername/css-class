        <h1>The History Of Pixel Fonts</h1>
        <h2>The first letters displayed on a screen<h2>
    
        <p>When computers were first coming into existence and screens needed to display informtion which of course meant making a way for making a way for them to display letter. 
        this then resulted in the creation of the first fonts being referred to as "bitmaps" which is most like if you took letters and filled in squares on a graph to make it look like letter.</p>
        
        <p>other names for bitmaps that you might hear for bitmaps are raster fonts or most common pixel fonts.
         bitmaps were most commonly used back with early computers due to the lack of processing power and memory bitmaps were basically forced to be the font of choice of early machines.
        some common places you might find bitmap fonts today is often places like the linux console, windows recovery console, and other places deep within operating systems of computers due do the the its how fast it can render, easy they are to make, giving the same output and readability no matter screen size</p>
